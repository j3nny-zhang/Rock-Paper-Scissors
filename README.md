# Rock-Paper-Scissors
While learning javascript, I decided to create a "Rock-Paper-Scissors" game using my knowledge of if-statements.<br>
I decided to approach the game by having the system generate a random number from 0 to 2, each number representing either rock, paper, or scissors. Then, taking the user's input (string), which is then assigned to a number as well (also 0 to 2), I used if-statements to create conditions to check if: <br\><br\>

If the numbers of user input (which I named, "player") and the random generated number (which I named, "generate) equated each other, then there was a tie. <br\>

Since I assigned 0 to "rock", 1 to "paper", and 2 to "scissors", I created two more if-statements to check when the player, and when the system, or "generate", wins or loses the game.
